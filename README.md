# Sentiment Analysis
# Abstract
This project enhances sentiment analysis on noisy social media text by combining text features with emoji sentiment scores. YouTube comments are cleaned and analyzed using VADER and emoji sentiment data. A Logistic Regression model classifies sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral for better interpretation.
# Problem Statement
Many people use social media platforms like YouTube to share opinions through comments. These comments often include slang, spelling mistakes, and emojis, which makes it difficult for normal sentiment analysis models to understand the true meaning. 
This project aims to solve that problem by improving how we detect emotions and opinions in noisy and informal text using both words and emojis together.
